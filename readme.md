Card Whisperer is an react-native and react built app utilizing machine learning in order to train the Googe Cloud Vision API. 

We designed this app for our teacher's friend who is unable to play normal playing card games due to blindness, and mentioned that
current recognition apps have not been trained on specific cards. 

We put through over 1800 cards for a standard playing card deck to have it recognize each card uniquely. 

After that we created an assertion to connect privately to our trained API model and utilized JWT-simple to 
access the assertion within our code and to update the assertion dynamically.
